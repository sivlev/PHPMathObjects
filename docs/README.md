# PHPMathObjects Documentation

The prebuilt documentation is not stored in the repository. To generate it on your local machine, make sure that you have [phpDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org/) installed and run `phpdoc` in the top-level folder of the project. The documentation will be generated in the `docs` folder. The configuration file for phpDocumentor is `phpdoc.dist.xml`.

See the main [README.md](../README.md) file for a quick API reference and the demo files in the [examples](../examples) folder.
